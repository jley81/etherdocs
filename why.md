# What can Ethereum Do?
### Ori Pomerantz qbzzt1@gmail.com 

In this essay I am going to attempt to explain [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) and why I think the general concept 
(blockchain verified computer programs) is going to be incredibly important for our economic future.

## Background: The Value of Trust

The basic of our economic system is trust. My employer trusts that even though I work from home with minimal supervision,
the work I'm assigned will get done. I trust that they'll deposit the agreed upon salary into my bank account, and that the
bank will not "disappear" that money. When I go to Target to buy food, I trust that the food is what the package promises. 
Target trusts me not to claim my debit card was stolen and attempt to reverse the charges, and the bank to transfer the correct
amount of money from my account to Target's.

Over time we evolved many mechanisms to verify and enforce this trust such as credit reports, regulatory bodies, and 
the courts. Ethereum is essentially another such mechanism, one that works in a distributed fashion without a central 
authority.


## Blockchains and Decentralized Trust

A blockchain is a way to tie messages together, so that to vouch for one of them being true an entity has to vouch that
all of them are true.

## Blockchains
At its root, a blockchain is a mechanism to tie commitments together, in a way that makes it extremely difficult to 
pretend that a commitment does not exist, or to hide it. For example, bitcoin uses a blockchain for currency transactions. 
At any moment anybody can check my balance and see how many bitcoins (BTC) I have. If I have ten BTC and I commit that you get five 
of them, everybody sees that I now only have five left. If I then try to commit to give somebody else seven BTC, it will be 
immediately clear that this commitment is impossible. This is much safer commerce than giving you a $5 check and then somebody 
else a $7 check, where the first one to the bank gets the money and the second gets a bounced check. 

### Ethereum
Ethereum takes the blockchain concept a level further by allowing whole contracts to be written in a computer language 
and executed in a manner that anybody can verify on a blockchain. This means they are deterministic, and it is possible to 
know in advance what a contract will enforce given a set of inputs. There is no room for subjective interpretation, or even 
honest misunderstandings.
