# What can Ethereum Do?
### Ori Pomerantz qbzzt1@gmail.com 

In this essay I am going to attempt to explain [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) and why I think the general concept 
(blockchain verified computer programs) is going to be incredibly important for our economic future.

## Background

Our economy is based on specialization and trade. Trade requires commitments, promises that are often formalized in 
contracts. Contracts are supposed to be enforced by the court system, but that system is slow and inefficient. 
[According to Court Statistics Project](http://www.courtstatistics.org/~/media/microsites/files/csp/data%20pdf/csph_online2.ashx) 
the median cost for contract litigation is $91,000 (see p. 7). This means that many times breaches of contract are allowed
because the cost to litigate them is higher than the cost of the breach.




## Blockchains
At its root, a blockchain is a mechanism to tie commitments together, in a way that makes it extremely difficult to 
pretend that a commitment does not exist, or to hide it. For example, bitcoin uses a blockchain for currency transactions. 
At any moment anybody can check my balance and see how many bitcoins (BTC) I have. If I have ten BTC and I commit that you get five 
of them, everybody sees that I now only have five left. If I then try to commit to give somebody else seven BTC, it will be 
immediately clear that this commitment is impossible. This is much safer commerce than giving you a $5 check and then somebody 
else a $7 check, where the first one to the bank gets the money and the second gets a bounced check. 

### Ethereum
Ethereum takes the blockchain concept a level further by allowing whole contracts to be written in a computer language 
and executed in a manner that anybody can verify on a blockchain. This means they are deterministic, and it is possible to 
know in advance what a contract will enforce given a set of inputs. There is no room for subjective interpretation, or even 
honest misunderstandings.
