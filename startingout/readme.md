# Getting Started with Ethereum Development

This tutorial teaches you how to get started with Ethereum development. While it explains certain features of the Solidity programming language, it does not go into it in depth. For that I recommend [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/). This tutorial is more focused on setting up a development environment and getting a complete application deployed.

The directions in this tutorial assume you are using Linux (or possibly another modern variant of UNIX). If you are using Windows, [you can install Linux on top of that](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview). 

## Setting up the Environment

1. The software we use is based on `npm`, the [Node.js Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/). The command to do this on versions of Linux that are based on Debian, such as Ubuntu, is:
```
sudo apt install npm
```
