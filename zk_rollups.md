# Zero Knowledge Rollups in Ethereum
### Ori Pomerantz qbzzt1@gmail.com 

In this article you learn about the scaling problem in Ethereum, and how zero knowledge rollups can
solve it.

## Background: Consensus and Scaling

Rather than relying on a trusted central authority, blockchains rely on consensus. The problem is
that consensus doesn't scale very well. This problem is especially bad in Ethereum, because nodes don't 
just relay data, they have to actually execute the software that is embedded in contracts. In December
2019, [Ethereum averaged 12-15 transactions per 
second](https://blog.bybit.com/research-and-analysis/ethereum-blockchain-performance-and-scalability/).


## Rollups

The preferred solution is to roll multiple transactions up into a single transaction.
